## Installation

Choose your preferred installation method:

### Option 1: Via Smithery (Universal - Recommended) 🌐

Install automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@keithah/tessie-mcp):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @keithah/tessie-mcp
```

**Benefits of Smithery Installation:**
- ✅ Works with any MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, Kiro, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)
- ✅ Automatic updates when new versions are released
- ✅ HTTPS remote access - no local installation required
- ✅ Secure configuration management
- ✅ Cross-device configuration sync
- ✅ One-command installation and setup

**After installation**, you'll be prompted to configure your Tessie API token. See the [Configuration](#configuration) section below for details.

### Option 2: Manual HTTPS Configuration (Remote Access)

For direct HTTPS access without the Smithery CLI, add to your MCP client configuration:

**Claude Desktop** (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tessie": {
      "url": "https://server.smithery.ai/@keithah/tessie-mcp/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**Kiro** (`.kiro/settings/mcp.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tessie": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@smithery/cli", "run", "@keithah/tessie-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Other MCP Clients**: Consult your client's documentation for adding remote MCP servers via HTTPS.

### Option 3: MCPB Package (For MCP Clients)

1. Download the latest `tessie-mcp-v*.mcpb` file from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/keithah/tessie-mcp/releases)
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file to install it in your MCP client
3. Enable the extension in your client settings
4. Configure your Tessie API token when prompted

### Prerequisites

- **MCP-compatible client** (Claude Desktop v0.10.0+, Kiro, Cursor, Windsurf, or any MCP client)
- **Tessie account** with API access from [tessie.com](https://tessie.com)
- **Node.js** v18.0.0 or later (only for local development, not required for Smithery installation)

## Configuration

### Getting Your Tessie API Token

The server requires your Tessie API token to access your Tesla vehicle data:

1. **Log into Tessie**: Visit https://my.tessie.com and sign in
2. **Navigate to API Settings**: Go to Settings → API (or visit https://my.tessie.com/settings/api directly)
3. **Copy Your Token**: Your API token will be displayed on this page
4. **Keep It Secret**: Treat this token like a password - it provides full access to your vehicle data

### Configuring the Token

**For Smithery Installation:**
When you first connect to the server, your MCP client will prompt you to enter the `TESSIE_API_KEY`. Simply paste your token from the steps above.

**For Manual Configuration:**
Add the token to your MCP client's configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tessie": {
      "url": "https://server.smithery.ai/@keithah/tessie-mcp/mcp",
      "env": {
        "TESSIE_API_KEY": "your-tessie-api-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**For Local Development:**
Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
TESSIE_API_KEY=your-tessie-api-token-here
```

### Verifying Configuration

After configuration, test the connection by asking your MCP client:
- "What's my Tesla's current battery level?"
- "Show me my vehicle status"

If you see vehicle data, you're all set! If you get an authentication error, double-check your API token.

### Upgrading

- **Smithery**: Run the install command again to upgrade to the latest version
- **MCPB**: Download and install the new `.mcpb` file (automatically replaces the old version)
- **Manual HTTPS**: No action needed - Smithery automatically serves the latest version

## 🌐 Using HTTPS Remote Access

One of the key benefits of Smithery deployment is HTTPS remote access - your MCP server runs in the cloud, so you don't need Node.js or any local installation.

### How It Works

```
Your MCP Client (Claude, Kiro, etc.)
         ↓ HTTPS
Smithery Cloud Infrastructure
         ↓ API Calls
Tessie API → Your Tesla
```

### Benefits

**No Local Installation Required:**
- No Node.js installation needed on your machine
- No package management or dependency issues
- Works on any device with an MCP-compatible client

**Always Up-to-Date:**
- Automatic updates when new versions are released
- No manual upgrade process required
- Always running the latest stable version

**Cross-Device Sync:**
- Configure once, use everywhere
- Same API token works across all your devices
- Consistent experience on desktop, laptop, etc.

**Reliable & Scalable:**
- Hosted on Smithery's infrastructure with high availability
- Automatic scaling during high usage
- Professional monitoring and maintenance

### Example Usage Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Quick Setup on a New Device**
```bash
# On your new laptop - just one command!
npx -y @smithery/cli install @keithah/tessie-mcp

# Enter your TESSIE_API_KEY when prompted
# Start using immediately - no build, no dependencies
```

**Scenario 2: Multiple MCP Clients**
```json
// Use the same server in Claude Desktop
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tessie": {
      "url": "https://server.smithery.ai/@keithah/tessie-mcp/mcp"
    }
  }
}

// And in Kiro
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tessie": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@smithery/cli", "run", "@keithah/tessie-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Scenario 3: Team Sharing**
Each team member can install the same server with their own Tessie API token:
```bash
# Team member 1
npx -y @smithery/cli install @keithah/tessie-mcp
# Uses their own TESSIE_API_KEY

# Team member 2
npx -y @smithery/cli install @keithah/tessie-mcp
# Uses their own TESSIE_API_KEY

# Everyone gets the same features, isolated configurations
```

## Smart VIN Resolution

The server automatically handles vehicle identification:

- **Single Active Vehicle**: If you have one active Tesla, it's used automatically
- **Multiple Vehicles**: If you have multiple active vehicles, you'll be prompted to choose
- **No Active Vehicles**: Clear error messages if no vehicles are available

## Experimental FSD Detection

**⚠️ Important Disclaimer**: The FSD detection feature is experimental and provides **estimates only**. It is not verified by Tesla or Tessie and should not be considered accurate for official purposes.

### How It Works

The server analyzes driving patterns to estimate when Full Self-Driving might have been active:

- **Speed Consistency**: FSD maintains very consistent speeds, especially on highways
- **Heading Smoothness**: FSD produces smooth, predictable steering patterns  
- **Route Characteristics**: FSD is more commonly used on highways and longer trips
- **Duration Analysis**: FSD usage typically correlates with longer drive segments

### Confidence Scoring

Each analysis receives a confidence score (0-100%):
- **80-100**: Very High - Strong FSD-like patterns detected
- **60-79**: High - Likely FSD usage based on multiple indicators
- **40-59**: Moderate - Mixed signals, uncertain
- **20-39**: Low - Likely manual driving
- **0-19**: Very Low - Manual driving patterns

### Limitations

- **No Ground Truth**: Tesla doesn't provide official FSD usage data
- **Pattern-Based Only**: Analysis relies on driving patterns, not direct FSD status
- **Individual Variation**: Driving styles vary; what looks like FSD for one person might be manual for another
- **External Factors**: Weather, traffic, and road conditions can affect patterns
- **Experimental Feature**: This is a research tool, not a definitive measurement

Use FSD detection results for personal analysis and insights, but don't rely on them for anything requiring precision.
