# Overview
Source: https://developer.tessie.com/reference/about

About our platform

Tessie is a management platform for Tesla drivers and fleet managers, providing apps, analytics, automations, integrations and APIs for Tesla vehicles and energy products.

We provide access to [Tesla Fleet API](/reference/access-tesla-fleet-api), [Tesla Fleet Telemetry](/reference/access-tesla-fleet-telemetry) and [our own API](/reference/tesla-api-comparison).


# Access Tesla Fleet API
Source: https://developer.tessie.com/reference/access-tesla-fleet-api

Fleet API is the official API for interacting with Tesla vehicles and energy products

Tessie provides full access to Tesla Fleet API. We've also built in significant improvements:

* Get instant access to Tesla Fleet API without an extremely complex and lengthy setup process
* Save up to 99% off your Tesla Fleet API bill with unlimited and free vehicle data polling
* Drop-in replacement for developers migrating existing applications from existing Tesla APIs
* Use a simple API key instead of building complex OAuth systems
* Automatic routing between North America, Europe and China Fleet API regions
* Automatic Vehicle Command Protocol command signing

## Get started

Simply point any Fleet API request at `api.tessie.com`.

Provide your access token in an Authorization header or as the access\_token query parameter. [Learn more.](/reference/authentication)

Visit the [Tesla Fleet API Reference](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api) to see all endpoints.

### Example Fleet API requests

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash theme={null}
  curl -H "Authorization: <ROTATING_TESLA_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
  	https://fleet-api.prd.na.vn.cloud.tesla.com/api/1/vehicles

  curl -H "Authorization: <ROTATING_TESLA_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
  	https://fleet-api.prd.eu.vn.cloud.tesla.com/api/1/vehicles

  curl -H "Authorization: <ROTATING_TESLA_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
  	https://fleet-api.prd.cn.vn.cloud.tesla.cn/api/1/vehicles
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Example drop-in replacement

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash theme={null}
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  	https://api.tessie.com/api/1/vehicles
  ```
</CodeGroup>


# Access Tesla Fleet Telemetry
Source: https://developer.tessie.com/reference/access-tesla-fleet-telemetry

Fleet Telemetry is an end-to-end encrypted telemetry data stream generated by your vehicle

Tessie provides full access to Tesla Fleet Telemetry. We've also built in significant improvements:

* Get instant access to Tesla Fleet Telemetry without an extremely complex and lengthy setup process
* Just connect to your dedicated streaming endpoint and you're done; no servers or hosting required

## Requirements

See [this page](https://help.tessie.com/article/128-direct-telemetry) for the latest vehicle requirements.

## Get started

Using any WebSocket client, connect to: `streaming.tessie.com/YOUR_VIN`

Provide your access token in an Authorization header or as the access\_token query parameter. [Learn more.](/reference/authentication)

Visit [streaming.tessie.com/explorer](https://streaming.tessie.com/explorer) for an example implementation. Check the page source code.

# Authentication
Source: https://developer.tessie.com/reference/authentication

One simple token that works everywhere

## Create a token

Visit [developer settings](https://dash.tessie.com/settings/api) and select *Generate Access Token*.

## Use your token

### In a header

The recommended and most secure method is to pass your token in a header:

`Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`

### In the URL

For easy debugging and specific applications, it can be helpful to pass your token as the access\_token query parameter instead.

<Warning>
  Do not pass your access token in the URL on insecure networks or behind VPNs where traffic logs could potentially be snooped.
</Warning>

## Examples

You can use all APIs using a single Tessie access token:

### Tesla Fleet API

`https://api.tessie.com/api/1/vehicles?access_token=YOUR_TOKEN`

### Tesla Fleet Telemetry

`wss://streaming.tessie.com/YOUR_VIN?access_token=YOUR_TOKEN`

### Tessie API

`https://api.tessie.com/vehicles?access_token=YOUR_TOKEN`

# Compare APIs
Source: https://developer.tessie.com/reference/tesla-api-comparison

Choose from three APIs depending on how you want to integrate

* Our [Tesla Fleet API layer](https://developer.tessie.com/reference/access-tesla-fleet-api) allows you to instantly access Tesla Fleet API without any prior registration or setup. It includes many enhancements on top of Fleet API, like unlimited vehicle\_data polling at no additional cost, streamlined authorization and automatic Vehicle Command Protocol signing. This is recommended for developers migrating existing applications from the Tesla Owner API or Tesla Fleet API.
* Our [Tesla Fleet Telemetry streaming API](https://developer.tessie.com/reference/access-tesla-fleet-telemetry) allows you to stream data directly from your vehicle without setting up your own Fleet Telemetry domain and servers.
* The Tessie API (represented by the endpoints listed on this site) is built on our Tesla Fleet API layer, but includes many additional data endpoints and further enhancements to vehicle controls, like automatic wakes and automatic firmware error handling. This is recommended for most developers starting something new.

You can mix and match all three as you need using a single Tessie access token. No fuss; it just works.
